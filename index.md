# Sun Following Solar Panel Phone Charger
My goal is to make a solar panel capable of charging my phone. In order to maximize the 0utput of the panel, it will be able to follow the sun as it moves throughout the sky.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was creating the stand for my panel, as well as getting my photoresistor to read. Building the stand came with some frustration, as I realized that after I had already built it, my design was flawed and I had to rework it. After completing this I was able to hook up my photoresistor to my Arduino and run some code for it to output some data. The photoresistor worked great, giving low values in low light and high values in high light.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was proving that my solar panel worked, as well as running the sweep command on my servo! Both of these things were essential for my project, because the servo and panel are two very important parts of my project. To prove the panel worked, I bought a cheap flashlight and took out the LED. I then hooked it up to the solar panel's jumper cables, and was able to make it shine brightly!
